<b>Custom craft beer tour</b> - SD is well known as one of the world's foremost places for craft beer businesses and there are new distilleries popping up literally every week in neighborhood locations. Within 3 miles where I live, there are probably more than a half dozen and a 2 new ones being built that I know of. Although not the original Stone Brewery, there is a satellite brewery in my area.
<p>
<b>Authentic "Mexican" tacos</b> (this side of the border) - In neighborhoods you'd want to go to only during the day, there are a number of well known places you can buy authentic mexican tacos. you don't have to cross the border to get the real thing and it's not the same as what you find in ordinary restaurants.
<p>
<b>Wild Animal Park</b> (zipline ride) - World famous, the zip line ride is a bit expensive but supposedly a unique experience over the park.
<p>
<b>SD Zoo</b> - Always a unique experience
<p>
<b>Spreckels Organ Pavillion (and other Museums)</b> - Various free performances at Sprckels, various museums in Balboa Park. Also vintage automobile museums in No Park where you can see literally one of a kind (last one nowhere else in world).
<p>
<b>Beach area activities(biking, walking, sailing)</b> = For people who are into actually doing something instead of just looking. Plenty of choices and nearly guaranteed clear, pleasant weather.
<p>
<b>Foods, but let me know beforehand.</b> From what I've seen most/all of you find places very differently than how I do. I rarely check Yelp and I generally stay away from any place which is busy (One of my past business partners selected restaurants this way, he judged based on how packed the parking lot was). I prefer small, out of the way places and am willing to take a chance on a crappy looking, hole in the wall owned by a single proprietor.  In fact, I usually stay far away from any 5 star restaurant, but if you want to try this...
-- Thee Bungalow (Ocean Beach). Even when the area was downtrodden with prostitution and drugs and 90% welfare, people regularly drove their rolls royce, bentleys, jaguars and whatnot nightly to this restaurant.
-- If you like Middle East/Lebanese food, I know a small buffet restaurant which serves excellent authentic arabic cuisine even at a buffet. Although they also offer Greek, except for their lemon soup (a standard Greek faire), I have less of an opinion.
-- If you like Italian food, I know a small Italian restaurant where older generation Italian immigrants come to dine and take out. Reasonable prices. Run by a second generation couple, when I first discovered this place they were young and starting out but already had a reputation with the "old folk." Today it appears they have a decent sized family.
-- If you like wraps, the coffee shop I go to serves wraps and sandwiches. Excellent and cheap (typical combo is <$10).

<b>Sunrise hike (Stonewall Peak)</b> - I haven't hiked this in many years, but it's a nice "day" activity. Get up around 3AM, drive an hour and hike 5 miles to this small peak. From there you can see the lights of parts of Los Angeles, watch the sun come up over Palm Springs, Mt Gorgonio and Mt Jacinto, and look down on San Diego and the Coronado Islands near the USA/Mexico border
<p>
<b>Anza Borrego Desert</b> - Various "Day hikes" and a resort about 1.5 hrs from San Diego
<p>
<b>Cowles Mtn Day hike</b> - Popular biking and hiking destination less than 10 miles from UTC. I've never been up this peak, but it's one of the highest in San Diego so should have a great view.
<p>
<b>Petco Park tour</b> = Weekly guided tour through the bowels of one of the newest baseball park destinations.
<p>
<b>Whale watching.</b> I'm pretty sure is within the season although not the middle of the season for the southward migration. Alternative to the Harbor Excursion we did last time. But you'll have to leave me out, I'd be seriously sea sick.
<p>
<b>Deep Sea fishing.</b> There are possibilities year round from the short trips to the Pt Loma kelp beds to half and full day trips to the Coronado Islands. Leave me out due to sea sickness.
<p>
<b>Pt Loma attractions...</b><br />
Lighthouse<br />
Kelp factory<br />
Longest pier on the West Coast<br />
Shopping/Eating/Wandering the converted MCRD (now known Liberty Station)
<p>
LA day trips - Practically any Los Angeles destination within a 3hr drive from San Diego. If that is too long a drive, a base of operations (hotel or home) is possible
<p>
<b>Possible SD hotel locations</b>
Downtown - Various Hi-rise (low vacancy so who knows what $$ might be?)
Rancho Bernardo
(near ctr of town, outskirts, inland, coast)
<p>
<b>If people are interested in any of the Day hikes I've listed,</b> they are <7 miles round trip. The trails are dirt and across country, not "improved." Should wear proper hiking boots, although not time of year for rattle snakes, it's always a possibility. Should bring canteen of water, snacks, first aid and more(eg if seriously lost, consider how to survive to next day). If you're injured badly, you'd likely have to be flown out. Not likely vehicles can get to most of these places.
